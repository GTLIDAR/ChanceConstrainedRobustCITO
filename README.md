# ChanceConstrainedCITO
Repository for Chance-Constrained Robust Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
## Overview
This respository is an implementation of the chance constrained robust contact-implicity trajectory optimization. Our work uses chance constraints as a probability-based constraint relaxation method and Expected Residual Minimization (ERM) as a smoothing method for solving complementarity problems with uncertain contact characteristics. Our method is tested on a bench marking push block over terrain with uncertain friction and a footed hopper robot over terrain with uncertain contact distance.
